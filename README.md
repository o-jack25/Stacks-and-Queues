# Stacks and Queues

For this lab I had to show knowledge on how to implement a stack and a queue.

In main1.cpp, I was tasked with implementing a stack class using a linked list with the functions: Stack, isEmpty, isFull, Top, Push, and Pop. I first had to allocate a stack object and insert individual items to the stack. Next, I was to remove and print three items from the stack. Then, I had to insert items onto the stack. Finally, I was to use a loop that prints and removes the items on the stack until it was empty.

In main2.cpp, I was tasked with implementing a queue using a circular array using the functions: Queue, isEmpty, isFull, enQueue, and deQueue. I first had to insert items to the queue, remove and print two items from the queue, insert words individually to the queue, write a loop that removes and prints the items in the queue until it is empty, and print a message when the queue was empty. Lastly, I had to isert 3 more items to the queue and write a loop that removes and prints the items in the queue until it was empty.

In main3.cpp, I was tasked with repeating the directions that were given in main2.cpp. However, I was to use a linked list where every node is allocated as needed and properly freed when no longer in use.
